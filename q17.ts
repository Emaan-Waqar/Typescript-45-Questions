// Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table wonâ€™t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

// â€¢ Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

// â€¢ Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
// a message to that person letting them know youâ€™re sorry you canâ€™t invite them to dinner.

// â€¢ Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know theyâ€™re still invited.

// â€¢ Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end
// of your program.
